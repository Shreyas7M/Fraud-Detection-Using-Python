## Financial Crime & Credit Card Fraud Detection (Machine Learning Project)

This repository contains my end-to-end machine learning project focused on detecting instances of financial crime, specifically credit card fraud. Fraud is a major challenge for modern organizations, with attackers constantly evolving their techniques. This project demonstrates practical strategies to analyze fraud data, build supervised ML models, evaluate their performance, and identify the most effective approach for real-world use.

### 🔍 Project Overview
- The goal of this project is to build, evaluate, and optimize machine learning models that can detect fraudulent credit card transactions.
The workflow includes:
- Using Python to analyze a sample credit card fraud dataset
- Preprocessing and engineering features for highly imbalanced data
- Training various supervised ML models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Generating and interpreting fraud-specific performance metrics
- Selecting the optimal classification model using threshold tuning and cost-based evaluation
- Applying techniques to improve model performance, including sampling strategies
- This side project helped me sharpen my fraud-analytics and ML modelling skills—skills that are increasingly in demand within financial crime, risk, and data science roles.
